        <p id="About">About Running</p>
        <p id="R">I like running a lot. It is because it gives strength to your legs and it is also a lovely workout. I think it will be painful when you try it at first, but as you practise you will get used to it. Once I had to run 5 times around the tennis court. It surely was painful. But as I was running slowly, it did'nt really matter. Do you know the secret of winning a running race? Well I'll tell you. <br><br><br><br>
            The secret is that half way you will have to run slowly. Then after half way, you sprint with the remaining energy. That is the way you overtake the other participants in the race. Well... Now I have told you all everything I know. <br> So GOODBYE!</p>

        <h2 id="Luck">Maybe the Ones I Haven't Told You All About</h2>
        <p id="Sec">Secrets are like if there is a running race team, we always go from fastest to slowest. It is because the fastest will be leading in your race. So it doesn't matter if the slowest is going to slow because he or she is aldready ahead in the race! Well you can also do the opposite way , slowest to fastest, so that the slow people can go at their speed while the fastest can sprint up the finishing line and win the race (if luck may have that!). <br><br> Well the second secret is that you will have to stretch as much as you can and have a little jog. That way your muscles will get loose and you will get the hang of it. <br><br> Now I have told every little secret I know. <br><br> So GOODBYE! </p>
